The list of GO terms for sorghum bicolor was downloaded from Phytozome and uploaded to the MSU HPCC. A unique gene list was formatted by removing all columns except for column 2 (the locus names) from the GO terms file and sorting and removing duplicate instances of a gene. Using this gene list and the GO terms files, a topGO table was created using a shell script with a while loop. This script and the output Sorghum_topGO.tsv table were uploaded to GitHub and the table was downloaded to the local computer.

GO.db and topGO were installed in R and the libraries were loaded. The Sorghum_topGO.tsv table was read into R, as was the DESeq2_results.tsv table that was generated in the previous assignment. Gene lists of both the higher and lower expressed genes were created and both were used for GO term enrichment for all GO terms elements (i.e., Biological Processes, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component). Results tables were generated for each and uploaded to GitHub, along with the R script that was used.

Of the higher expressed genes, there were 1058 BP terms found, 636 MF terms found, and 259 CC terms found. Of the lower expressed genes, there were the same amount of terms for each category, respectively, found.
