To first determine whether the samples came from a stranded, unstranded, or reverse stranded library, a test script for HTSeq-count was uploaded to the MSU HPCC in which HTSeq-count was used with one sample with all three strandedness arguments. These results indicated that the data came from an unstranded library as the unstranded argument led to the least number of "no_feature" in the read count table. With this in mind, another script was written to run HTSeq-count on the rest of the samples using the file input as bam, order as pos, strandedness as unstranded, and the output file type as .tsv. This script was uploaded to the MSU HPCC. The resulting read count tables as well as the shell script were uploaded to GitHub.

These tables were copied to the local computer, renamed to indicate the treatment type of the sample (well_watered or drought), and compiled into a directory together. These read counts were then imported into R in which they were compiled into a single table. This countsTable was used to create a DESeq2 object using the command "DESeqDataSetFromHTSeqCount". The data was prefiltered to remove any genes that had a count lower than 10, and the normalized using a variance stabilizing transformation. DESeq was then used to call differentially expressed genes, specifically using the Wald Test. Using an adjusted p-value of 0.05, 4175 genes were found to be differentially expressed. A volcano plot (MA plot) was generated from the data and a pdf of the resultant plot was uploaded to GitHub. The R script used was also uploaded to GitHub.
