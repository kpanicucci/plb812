Genome and annotation files of sorghum bicolor were downloaded from NCBI onto the local computer.  The accession used for this data was PRJNA13876. These files were then uploaded to the MSU HPCC using the SSH file transfer protocol (sftp). The files were not compressed so no further actions were taken.The SRA data for genotype IS20351 were located through NCBI and the SRR numbers were found: SRR3452722, SRR3452721, SRR3452720, SRR3452719, SRR3452718, and SRR3452717. These SRR files were downloaded to the MSU HPCC using the SRA Toolkit version 3.0.0. The SRA file formats were converted to gzipped fastq files using fastq-dump.
