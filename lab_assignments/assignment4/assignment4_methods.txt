Hisat2, gffread, and samtools were installed in the plb812 conda environment using the Bioconda channel.

To build the index, the gene annotation (gff file) was first converted to a gtf file using gffread. Using this gtf file, splice sites and exons were extracted using hisat2_extract_splice_sites and hisat2_extract_exons. A shell script was written to build the index using the exon file, splice site file, and the genome assembly file. The output name was sorghum_index. This script was uploaded to GitHub.

Alignment for each trimmed fastq file was accomplished using hisat2. This was done using 10 threads to expedite the process. The SRR data was paired-end, so the hisat2 command was written accordingly. The output was converted to a BAM file using samtools view with 4 threads and the output was sorted using samtools sort, again with 4 threads. The output gave the total number of read pairs and how many aligned concordantly (and how many times). This information was compiled into a csv table titled "alignment_stats" and was pushed to GitHub.
